# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch
A repository containing code for my journey of self-learning DL.

## Requirements
You need Python of course, aside from that, you can run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Furthermore, the DL stuff is run with PyTorch, so you will need to install PyTorch, which can either run solely on CPU or GPU depending on your device. To see which version of PyTorch is suitable for your machine, please visit [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
